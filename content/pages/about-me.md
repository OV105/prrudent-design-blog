# Prudent Design
**Prudent** judicious,wise,responsible - **Design** conception,plan,intention

As a software engineer I have worked in industrial cyber security, streaming video over satellite internet, and Linux development. I have experience in all phases of the development life cycle; from design to implementation, to testing, to deployment and support. The projects I have been involved in called for writing code in Python, C, Perl, Clojure, Bash and Java.

The catalyst for this site was the tension between taking the time to design a solution and the pressure add features. As a developer and QA engineer I have seen a number of projects where the final result as not exactly what was envisioned or the path was longer than it needed to be. I remember one of my early engineering professors telling me "You'll find there is never enough time to do it right, but there is always time to do it again"
